Further discussion about Project idea, with follwing questions-
- Should we invest in crypto or S&P500
- Do we need to host the database on AWS or on PosgreSQL?
- Time Series Model to Predict future prices for Bitcoin and/or for S&P 500.

Dataset plans-

1. Pulling 5 years worth of data from Yahoo finance to meet the 1K rows (2015-2020 full years) from both datasets
2. Columns that will be used for both tables:  
  * Date
  * Open Price
  * Volume (to round up for Bitcoin dataset)
  * Volatility (calculated column in both dataset)
3. To calculate volatility - https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/wealth-management/volatility-vol/
4. Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM
5. Top 5 Crypto - BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, DOGE
6. Top 5 S&P 500 -Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)

Actions -

1. Reasons why we chose selected topic.
2. We need an ERD diagram - Kirti (completed)
3. We need a write up for the questions - Hitha (completed)
4. Scrape csv from Yahoo - Emerset (completed)

Potential Summary Reflection:
Our goal is to present to the end user the data that shows the differences between crypto and S&P500 in order for them to make an informed decision for their investments.
