Historical prices
Future price prediction
Corelation with S&P 500 or any other variables?
Predicting volatility of Crypto vs S&P 500?
Question for the project : what should one invest in crypto (BTC, another coin) or S&P - (TBD)


Dataset -

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?period1=1577836800&period2=1673913600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true


Actions -

1. Yahoo dataset needs to be scraped.
2. Check any policy/ ethics or any disclaimers for using data from yahoo finance?
3. ERD diagram
4. Time frame for the study? how far back? and how far into the future? or a date range by user? TBD

Further discussion about Project idea, with follwing questions-
- Should we invest in crypto or S&P500
- Do we need to host the database on AWS or on PosgreSQL?
- Time Series Model to Predict future prices for Bitcoin and/or for S&P 500.

Dataset plans-

1. Pulling 5 years worth of data from Yahoo finance to meet the 1K rows (2015-2020 full years) from both datasets
2. Columns that will be used for both tables:  
  * Date
  * Open Price
  * Volume (to round up for Bitcoin dataset)
  * Volatility (calculated column in both dataset)
3. To calculate volatility - https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/wealth-management/volatility-vol/
4. Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM
5. Top 5 Crypto - BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, DOGE
6. Top 5 S&P 500 -Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)

Actions -

1. Reasons why we chose selected topic.
2. We need an ERD diagram - Kirti (completed)
3. We need a write up for the questions - Hitha (completed)
4. Scrape csv from Yahoo - Emerset (completed)

Potential Summary Reflection:
Our goal is to present to the end user the data that shows the differences between crypto and S&P500 in order for them to make an informed decision for their investments.

Charted out design plan for Tableau dashboard.
We will use regression model for data analysis and prediction.
Decided to scrape data from Yahoo finance for all the datasets.

Actions -

1. Scrape all datasets from yahoo to keep same source for all data points - Emerset (completed)
2. Update "Images" folder with sample charts for Tableau dashboard - Fareena (completed)
3. Clean and update Readme - Hitha (completed)
4. Create review data in pgadmin - Kirti (completed)

1. Went over Machine learning model Python code and got recommendations from Hassan to add a for-loop for a better time series model
2. Made sure everyone has Tableau Desktop or how to get it
3. Got trial version of Tableau Cloud to store our datasets
4. Hassan and Imran (replacement TA) advised that we do not need a confusion matrix nor an accuracy score since we used the root mean squared error to determine precision of ML model



Actions - 
1. Emerset, Hitha & Kirti to work on implementing the for loop in the code
2. Team to familiarize ourselves with Tableau Cloud- import datasets and start creating visualizations
3. Team to come back Wednesday with some starter visualizations done
