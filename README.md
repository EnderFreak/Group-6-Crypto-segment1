# Group 6 project:

# Cryptocurrency vs S&P 500 Analysis
Use machine learning, Python, and Tableau to analyze and predict top 5 cryptocurrencies with top 5 S&P500.


# Project Dashboard -TBD

# Project Links - TBD (future state - will include link to Tableau, slides, presentations)


# Overview 
Cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, has seen a tremendous amount of growth in recent years, with many investors turning to it as an alternative to traditional investments like stocks. In this project, we will compare the performance of top 5 S&P 500, a stock market index that represents the performance of the top 500 publicly traded companies in the United States, to that of top 5 cryptocurrency. 

The 5 cryptocurrencies used in this analysis are - 
1. Bitcoin (BTC) 
2. Ethererm (ETH)3.
3. Binance coin (BNB)
4. Cardano (ADA)
5. Dogecoin (DOGE).

The 5 S&P 500 used in the analysis are -
1. Apple Inc. (AAPL)
2. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
3. Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN)
4. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)
5. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)

We will use historical data on the prices of the top 5 cryptocurrencies and the top 5 companies in the S&P 500 to calculate their volatility. Standard deviation will be used as a measure of volatility and compare the results between the two asset classes. We will also use charts to visually represent the volatility of each asset over time.

# Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the performance of the top 5 cryptocurrencies with that of the top 5 companies in the S&P 500, specifically focusing on their volatility. Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in recent years as an alternative investment option to traditional stocks. This analysis aims to evaluate the risk and potential returns of investing in these two different asset classes.
